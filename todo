#verify level trigger + block fd will block on send or receive operation
>> verified, this is true

#epoll fd as level trigger and set fd as none block, but recv on one fd two times still will still block?
>> fix, set fd as none block not sucess. function implementation error. 

#one bug: send 500 time in client continuesly, server will block on socket.recv. although data is received, but it
didn't send out. use debug mode to check this issue, this issue will disappear, maybe this is related with 
send speed too quickly at client side. 

#client process cpu load very high, due to the event_out always happens, and always call messagesendcb. 
>> fixed. need disable out event when send finished. 

#use iperf to do performance test, 4k~100k bit/s is ok, but when reach 1m, server will exit, but didn't see any crash. 
>> fixed. In previous code, UP and Err event will handle first which lead to close fd and connection, but stil try to 
>> operate on the fd. So error happend, fd can't find.
